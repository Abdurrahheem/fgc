# DBTNet
MXNet version of the code for our NeurIPS'19 paper "Learning Deep Bilinear Transformation for Fine-grained Image Representation"


The model and a well-orgnized version of the code will be available in a week.

Note that we reimplement the 'BatchDot' function for faster training, which will be released later.
